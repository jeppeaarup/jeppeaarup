### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a BSc student in food science and technology at University of Copenhagen, Denmark. 

I have a special interest in data science and analytical chemistry for biotech industries in areas such as:

- Process analytical chemistry and technology (aka. industry 4.0)
- Statistical process control
- Statistical engineering and optimization
- Machine learning for analytical chemistry

... and a whole bunch of other chemometrics.
